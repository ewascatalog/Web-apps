# Inital database
./initial/database.sql - the SQL file that creates the EWAS_Catalog database and gives user access.

# CpG annotation
./cpgs/cpgs.sql - a SQL database of CpG annotation created using the Illumina 450k and EPIC array manifests from meffil.

# Gene information
./genes/genes.sql - a SQL database of gene information created using ensembl.

# Public literature database
./catalog/19-07-03/database.sql - a SQL database containing the current version of the public literature catalog.
./initial/ewas_catalog_23_11_2018.sql - a SQL database containing the previous version of the catalog.

# ARIES database
./aries/catalog/database.sql - a SQL database containing the current version of the ARIES results with p<1E-4.

# Database curation
./catalog/table.sql - this creates an empty mysql table with the necessary characteriscs for the public literature catalog. 
./catalog/input.sh - this creates the public catalog SQL database (database.sql) using the studies.txt and results.txt files in ./catalog/19-07-03/. The studies.txt and results.txt files are generated by exporting the database from the EWAS Catalog Input website. As mysql is not available on the server, this code will have to be run on a desktop with mysql installed. 
./catalog/table.sql - this creates an empty mysql table with the necessary characteriscs for the ARIES subset catalog.
./aries/input.sh - this creates the ARIES subset SQL database (database.sql) using the aries_*_studies.txt and aries_*_results.txt files in ./aries/catalog/. The aries_*_studies.txt and aries_*_results.txt files are generated from Tom's datasets. As mysql is not available on the server, this code will have to be run on a desktop with mysql installed.
