## Genome annotations

Scripts for creating text files annotating
CpG sites targeted by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (**cpgs.R**)
and protein-coding genes in the genome (**genes.R**).

Scripts for creating (**cpgs_table.sql**) 
and uploading (**cpgs_data.sh**) the CpG annotations to tables in a mySQL database.
*Not sure why there aren't similar scripts for the gene annotation.*
